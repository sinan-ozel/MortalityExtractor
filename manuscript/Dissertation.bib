Past research has suggested a number of bootstrap procedures when there are few clusters. I demonstrate, using Monte Carlo experiments, that these bootstrap procedures perform poorly with fewer than eleven clusters. With few clusters, the wild cluster bootstrap results in p-values that are not point identified. I suggest two alternative wild bootstrap procedures. Monte Carlo simulations provide evidence that a 6-point bootstrap weight distribution improves the reliability of inference. A brief empirical example concerning education tax credits highlights the implications of these findings.},

The usual solution is to calculate cluster-robust standard errors that permit heteroskedasticity and within-cluster error correlation, but presume that the number of clusters is large. Standard asymptotic tests can over-reject, however, with few (five to thirty) clusters. We investigate inference using cluster bootstrap-t procedures that provide asymptotic refinement. These procedures are evaluated using Monte Carlos, including the example of Bertrand, Duflo, and Mullainathan (2004). Rejection rates of 10\% using standard methods can be reduced to the nominal size of 5\% using our methods.},

From May 1990 until November 1990 teachers in the French community of Belgium stroked to obtain a salary increase. We exploit the political division of Belgium in a French community and a Flemish community, with similar educational institutions, for estimating the long-term effects of the strikes. Based on a difference-in-differences approach, using data from two different surveys, we find some evidence that the strikes reduced educational attainment and increased class repetition. We also find that the strikes led to a significant reallocation of students to a lower level of higher education.

These events provide a unique setting for investigating the returns to schooling and the effects of teacher absenteeism on the educational and labor market achievements of students. The political division of Belgium in two communities (French and Flemish) provides an ideal setting for a difference-in-differences approach, as only the students in the Frenchspeaking part were affected by the strikes. Using data from the Belgian Household Panel Survey, we compare the relative educational and labor market achievements of the young French and Flemish cohorts. We find evidence that the strikes have damaged significantly the labor market prospects of the young French-speaking generation. Overall, we estimate the negative effect of the teacher strikes on the earnings of young Frenchspeaking people to be around 11.5%.},

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
Homicide is an important cause of premature mortality globally, but evidence for the magnitude of homicides by intimate partners is scarce and hampered by the large amount of missing information about the victim{\textendash}offender relationship. The objective of the study was to estimate global and regional prevalence of intimate partner homicide.
Methods
A systematic search of five databases (Medline, Global Health, Embase, Social Policy, and Web of Science) yielded 2167 abstracts, and resulted in the inclusion of 118 full-text articles with 1122 estimates of the prevalence of intimate partner homicide after double-blind screening. All studies were included that reported the number or proportion of women or men who were murdered by an intimate partner in a country, province, or town, using an inclusive definition of an intimate partner. Additionally, a survey of official sources of 169 countries provided a further 53 estimates. We selected one estimate per country-year using a quality assessment decision algorithm. The median prevalence of intimate partner homicide was calculated by country and region overall, and for women and men separately.
Findings
Data were obtained for 66 countries. Overall 13{\textperiodcentered}5\% (IQR 9{\textperiodcentered}2{\textendash}18{\textperiodcentered}2) of homicides were committed by an intimate partner, and this proportion was six times higher for female homicides than for male homicides (38{\textperiodcentered}6\%, 30{\textperiodcentered}8{\textendash}45{\textperiodcentered}3, vs 6{\textperiodcentered}3\%, 3{\textperiodcentered}1{\textendash}6{\textperiodcentered}3). Median percentages for all (male and female) and female intimate partner homicide were highest in high-income countries (all, 14{\textperiodcentered}9\%, 9{\textperiodcentered}2{\textendash}18{\textperiodcentered}2; female homicide, 41{\textperiodcentered}2\%, 30{\textperiodcentered}8{\textendash}44{\textperiodcentered}5) and in southeast Asia (18{\textperiodcentered}8\%, 11{\textperiodcentered}3{\textendash}18{\textperiodcentered}8; 58{\textperiodcentered}8\%, 58{\textperiodcentered}8{\textendash}58{\textperiodcentered}8). Adjustments to account for unknown victim{\textendash}offender relationships generally increased the prevalence, suggesting that results presented are conservative.
Interpretation
At least one in seven homicides globally and more than a third of female homicides are perpetrated by an intimate partner. Such violence commonly represents the culmination of a long history of abuse. Strategies to reduce homicide risk include increased investment in intimate partner violence prevention, risk assessments at different points of care, support for women experiencing intimate partner violence, and control of gun ownership for people with a history of violence. Improvements in country-level data collection and monitoring systems are also essential, because data availability and quality varied strongly across regions.

	abstract = {Several empirical studies have suggested that neighborhood characteristics influence health, with most studies having focused on neighborhood deprivation or aspects of the physical environment, such as services and amenities. However, such physical characteristics are not the only features of neighborhoods that potentially affect health. Neighborhoods also matter because of the nature of their social organization. This study examined social capital as a potential neighborhood characteristic influencing health. Using a cross-sectional study design which linked counts of death for persons 45{\textendash}64 years by race and sex to neighborhood indicators of social capital and poverty for 342 Chicago neighborhoods in the USA, we tested the ecological association between neighborhood-level social capital and mortality rates, taking advantage of the community survey data collected as part of the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. We estimated a hierarchical generalized linear model to examine the association of race and sex specific mortality rates to social capital. Overall, neighborhood social capital{\textemdash}as measured by reciprocity, trust, and civic participation{\textemdash}was associated with lower neighborhood death rates, after adjustment for neighborhood material deprivation. Specifically, higher levels of neighborhood social capital were associated with lower neighborhood death rates for total mortality as well as death from heart disease and {\textquotedblleft}other{\textquotedblright} causes for White men and women and, to a less consistent extent, for Blacks. However, there was no association between social capital and cancer mortality. Although, the findings from this study extend the state-level findings linking social capital to health to the level of neighborhoods, much work remains to be carried out before social capital can be widely applied to improve population health, including establishing standards of measurement, and exploring the potential {\textquotedblleft}downsides{\textquotedblright} of social capital.},

This article investigates determinants of China{\textquoteright}s mortality levels and trends since 1981. Econometric results show that both economic development and social policies matter to survival outcomes, but in different magnitudes for various mortality measures. Economic growth plays a key role in reducing mortality in childhood and especially adulthood, and raises life expectancy. Declining adult illiteracy is a critical factor in reducing child mortality and increasing life expectancy. Stock of health practitioners, share of government expenditure for health and education, and policy biases favoring cities and coastal areas selectively affect survival. Authors propose policies for further reducing mortality in China today.},

Total mortality and nine of the ten sources of fatalities exhibit a procyclical variation, with suicides representing the important exception. The fluctuations in mortality are larger for 20-44 year olds than for older individuals. The predicted relationship between personal incomes and health is quite weak and is sensitive to the choice of model specifications, time periods and dependent variables.

	abstract = {Emerging evidence suggests that the degree of social cohesion is an important determinant of population health status. Citizens living in societies with a high degree of social cohesion {\textemdash} characterized by strong social networks and high levels of interpersonal trust {\textemdash} seem to be healthier than those living in socially disorganized societies. Epidemiologists have become interested in notions of civil society and social capital to explain variations in health across societies. The purpose of the present paper was to examine the role of social capital in the Russian mortality crisis. Social capital has been defined as those features of social organization {\textemdash} such as the density of civic associations, levels of interpersonal trust, and norms of reciprocity {\textemdash} that act as resources for individuals, and facilitate collective action. A civil society is one that is rich in stocks of social capital. Various scholars have argued that one of the distinguishing characteristics of the Soviet regime was the paucity of civil society. Using household survey data from the Ail-Russian Center for Public Opinion research (VTsIOM), we carried out a cross-sectional, ecologie analysis of the association between indicators of social capital and mortality rates across 40 regions of Russia. We found associations between indicators of social capital (mistrust in government, crime, quality of work relations, civic engagement in politics) and life expectancy, as well as mortality rates. In the absence of civil society, it is believed that far more people in post-Soviet Russia rely on informal sources of support (friends, family) to deal with their day to day problems. Those lacking such sources of support may have been especially vulnerable to the economic hardships following the transformation to a market economy.},

Children's IQs were assessed for a population sample of 1116 monozygotic and dizygotic 5-year-old twin pairs in England. Mothers reported their experience of domestic violence in the previous 5 years. Ordinary least squares regression showed that domestic violence was uniquely associated with IQ suppression in a dose{\textendash}response relationship. Children exposed to high levels of domestic violence had IQs that were, on average, 8 points lower than unexposed children. Structural equation models showed that adult domestic violence accounted for 4\% of the variation, on average, in child IQ, independent of latent genetic influences. The findings are consistent with animal experiments and human correlational studies documenting the harmful effects of extreme stress on brain development. Programs that successfully reduce domestic violence should also have beneficial effects on children's cognitive development.},

	abstract = {Sibling relationships can turn into rivalries that destroy family firms. In this article, clinical and theoretical research on families, organizations, and conflict resolution are drawn on to develop intervention strategies aimed at helping family firm members both increase awareness about forces that sustain destructive sibling conflicts and find ways of working through them. Competition for parental love and attention spurs sibling rivalry. Whether siblings become rivalrous depends largely on parental responses to this contest. Because adult brothers and sisters in family firms remain organizationally subordinated to their parents, they face unique challenges in overcoming sibling rivalry's harmful effects. Yet this is precisely the task confronting them if they are to sustain family management of their business through intergenerational succession.},

It differs from divorce threat bargaining models (e.g., Manser-Brown, McElroy-Horney) in that the threat point is not divorce but a noncooperative equilibrium within marriage; this noncooperative equilibrium reflects traditional gender roles. The predictions of our model thus differ from those of divorce threat bargaining models; in the separate spheres model, cash transfer payments to the mother and payments to the father can--but need not--imply different equilibrium distributions in existing marriages. In the long run, the distributional effects of transfer policies may be substantially altered by changes in the marriage market equilibrium.},

This paper examines the implications for fatalities when the relationship is interpreted as an induced relationship, meaning that lower incomes will on average lead to higher mortality risks. A model is developed for estimating the number of fatalities possibly induced by economic expenditures. This model accounts for different allocations of the expenditures on family units with varying income levels. Illustrative calculations provide insights about the possible significance of fatalities induced by economic expenditures. These results suggest that some expensive regulations and programs intended to save lives may actually lead to increased fatalities. Important caveats to reduce the likelihood of misinterpreting or misusing the results are included.},

For family income, differences between the highest and the lowest income groups were about 10 years for white men and 4.3 years for white women. The largest differences in life expectancy were between employment categories. At age 25, white men in the labor force lived on average about 12 more years than those not in the labor force, and white women lived on average about 9 more years. For those who were unable to work compared with those in the labor force, the difference for white men was about 20 years; for white women, 29 years. Results in this study showed much the same differentials in life expectancy for education as the earlier Kitagawa-Hauser study.},

Contemporaneous and time-lagged covariates were modeled, and all analyses were stratified by race/ethnicity. In all models, primary care was associated with lower mortality. An increase of one primary care doctor per 10,000 population was associated with a reduction of 14.4 deaths per 100,000. The magnitude of primary care coefficients was higher for black mortality than for white mortality. Income inequality was not associated with mortality after controlling for state-level sociodemographic covariates. The study provides evidence that primary care resources are associated with population health and could aid in reducing socioeconomic disparities in health.},

	abstract = {Although formal work on war generally sees war as a kind of bargaining breakdown resulting from asymmetric information, bargaining indivisibilities, or commitment problems, most analyses have focused on informational issues. But informational explanations and the models underlying them have at least two major limitations: they often provide a poor account of prolonged conflict, and they give an odd reading of the history of some cases. This article describes these limitations and argues that bargaining indivisibilities should really be seen as commitment problems. The present analysis then shows that a common mechanism links three important kinds of commitment problem: (1) preventive war, (2) preemptive attacks arising from first-strike or offensive advantages, and (3) conflicts resulting from bargaining over issues that affect future bargaining power. In each case, large, rapid shifts in the distribution of power can lead to war. Finally, the analysis elaborates a distinctly different mechanism based on a comparison of the cost of deterring an attack on the status quo with the expected cost of trying to eliminate the threat to the status quo.},

Recently, however, a group of criminologists have begun to consider ways in which crime itself might lead to employment problems. One idea, advanced by Hagan, is that youths involved in crime do not develop the necessary social and human capital necessary to succeed in the legal labor market. A second idea, advanced by Sampson and Laub, is that the formal sanctions of the criminal justice system lead employers to avoid individuals who might otherwise succeed in the labor market. This article tests the competing implications of these two theories by using the method of {\textquotedblleft}differences in differences{\textquotedblright} on the National Youth Survey. The evidence from this article suggests that arrest can lead to minor problems in the labor market above and beyond the impact of current or past criminal activity.},

The literature on international relations remains divided on whether, when, and how reputation matters in both interstate and intrastate conflict. We examine reputation building through a series of incentivized laboratory experiments. Using comparative statics from a repeated entry-deterrence game, we isolate how incentives for reputation building should change as the number of entrants changes. We find that subjects in our experiments generally build reputations and that those investments pay off, but we also find that some subjects did not react to incentives to build reputation in ways our model had predicted. In order to explain this, we focus on the heterogeneity of preferences and cognitive abilities that may exist in any population. Our research suggests that rational-choice scholars of international relations and those using more psychologically based explanations have more common ground than previously articulated.},

In particular, we consider what inferences can be made about the causal effect of teenage childbearing on a teen mother's subsequent outcomes when we use the natural experiment of miscarriages to form an instrumental variable for teen births. Miscarriages might not meet all of the conditions required for an instrumental variable to identify such causal effects for all of the observations in our sample. However, it is an appropriate instrumental variable for some women, namely those pregnant women who experience a random miscarriage. Although information from typical data sources does not allow one to identify these women, we show that one can adapt results from Horowitz and Manski (1995) on identification with data from contaminated samples to construct informative bounds on the causal effect of teenage childbearing. We use these bounds to re-examine the effects of early chilbearing on the teen mother's subsequent educational and labour market attainment as considered in Hotz, McElroy and Sanders (1995a, 1995b). Consistent with their study, these bounds indicate that women who have births as teens have higher labour market earnings and hours worked compared to what they would have attained if their childbearing had been delayed.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Recent studies have demonstrated that income inequality is related to mortality rates. It was hypothesized, in this study, that income inequality is related to reduction in social cohesion and that disinvestment in social capital is in turn associated with increased mortality. METHODS: In this cross-sectional ecologic study based on data from 39 states, social capital was measured by weighted responses to two items from the General Social Survey: per capita density of membership in voluntary groups in each state and level of social trust, as gauged by the proportion of residents in each state who believed that people could be trusted. Age-standardized total and cause-specific mortality rates in 1990 were obtained for each state. RESULTS: Income inequality was strongly correlated with both per capita group membership (r = -.46) and lack of social trust (r = .76). In turn, both social trust and group membership were associated with total mortality, as well as rates of death from coronary heart disease, malignant neoplasms, and infant mortality. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the notion that income inequality leads to increased mortality via disinvestment in social capital.},

	abstract = {The authors examined the associations of social support with socioeconomic status (SES) and with mortality, as well as how SES differences in social support might account for SES differences in mortality. Analyses were based on 9,333 participants from the British Whitehall II Study cohort, a longitudinal cohort established in 1985 among London-based civil servants who were 35{\textendash}55 years of age at baseline. SES was assessed using participant's employment grades at baseline. Social support was assessed 3 times in the 24.4-year period during which participants were monitored for death. In men, marital status, and to a lesser extent network score (but not low perceived support or high negative aspects of close relationships), predicted both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Measures of social support were not associated with cancer mortality. Men in the lowest SES category had an increased risk of death compared with those in the highest category (for all-cause mortality, hazard ratio = 1.59, 95\% confidence interval: 1.21, 2.08; for cardiovascular mortality, hazard ratio = 2.48, 95\% confidence interval: 1.55, 3.92). Network score and marital status combined explained 27\% (95\% confidence interval: 14, 43) and 29\% (95\% confidence interval: 17, 52) of the associations between SES and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, respectively. In women, there was no consistent association between social support indicators and mortality. The present study suggests that in men, social isolation is not only an important risk factor for mortality but is also likely to contribute to differences in mortality by SES.},

In states that introduced unilateral divorce we find a 8-16 percent decline in female suicide, roughly a 30 percent decline in domestic violence for both men and women, and a 10 percent decline in females murdered by their partners.},

	abstract = {This paper revisits the evidence on the impact of unilateral divorce laws on divorce rates in the United States. Most states switched from requiring mutual consent to allowing unilateral or no-fault divorce between 1970 and 1985, while the national divorce rate more than doubled after 1965. According to the Coase theorem, however, the legal shift should have had no effect on divorce rates. Recent papers using cross-sectional micro data have disputed the empirical importance of unilateral divorce, disagreeing in particular about controls for state-level heterogeneity in divorce propensities. This paper uses a panel of state-level divorce rates which includes virtually every divorce in the U.S. over the entire period of the law changes. Adding comprehensive controls - year and state fixed effects and state fixed trends - for changing unobservable divorce propensities reveals that the divorce rate would have been about 6\% lower if states had not switched to unilateral divorce, accounting for 17\% of the increase in the divorce rate between 1968 and 1988. Additional results in this paper demonstrate that the type of unilateral divorce law that states adopted matters. Weaker versions of unilateral divorce, which retain elements of mutual divorce, raised the divorce rate significantly, but by less than the strongest versions of unilateral divorce did.},

	abstract = {This paper extends the difference-in-differences method to the setting of repeated cross-sections when treatment status is observed in either the pre- or the post-treatment period, but not in both time periods. The issue in such a setting is that the outcomes that are observed in the period when the treatment status is missing cannot be classified into outcomes for the treated and outcomes for the control. As such, the standard difference-in-differences{\textbackslash}estimand cannot be calculated and the method cannot be used to point identify the average treatment effect on the treated. Our contribution is to show that the average treatment effect on the treated can still be point-identified by making use of the following observations (1) it is usually the case that the individual treatment status is observed in post-treatment household surveys even when it is not observed in pre-treatment surveys; (2) in most data sets, it is possible to find a proxy or a predictor for the treatment status; and (3) when samples are representative of the same population, the propensity score is stationary. Further, we show the point-identification of the distribution of outcomes conditional on the latent treatment status. We then propose a method of moments estimation strategy for the identified model. We illustrate our method on data from the Mexican conditional cash-transfer program PROGRESA, and we compare our results with those from a standard difference-in-differences analysis using the same data set.},

For low/middle income families, our results indicate an equilibrium in which one person's reservation utility constraint is binding, whereas for higher income families both individuals may gain from the relationship.},

Having been arrested is found to significantly reduce the probability of indigenous employment by 18.3 and 13.1 percentage points for males and females respectively. The effect also varies according to the reason for a person's most recent arrest. Differences in arrest rates between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians may explain about 15 per cent of the difference in the level of employment between those groups. Promoting diversion options should be a priority for governments keen to break the nexus between indigenous unemployment and crime.},

To test the effects of this variance, we randomly assigned short (X?= 2.8 hours), full (X?= 11.1 hours), and no arrests (warning only) to a sample of 1,200 cases with predominantly unemployed suspects concentrated in black ghetto poverty neighborhoods in Milwaukee. Victim interviews and one official measure showed that short arrest had a substantial initial deterrent effect relative to the warning group. Longer term follow-up and before-after analysis, however, found neither arrest group reflected any deterrence. On the most comprehensive official measure, short arrest consistently showed significantly higher long-term recidivism than no arrest. Its deterrent effect ended at 30 days, but its criminogenic effect was significant after one year. We conclude that short-custody arrests for domestic violence in poverty ghetto areas may pose a dilemma between short- and long-term crime control, but longer custody arrests have no clear long-term effect in either direction.},

The most convincing rationale for this assumption is the belief that efficient allocations are likely to emerge from repeated interactions in stationary environments, and that marriage provides such an environment. This paper argues that when a current decision affects future bargaining power, inefficient outcomes are plausible. If the spouses could make binding commitments{\textendash}in effect, commitments to refrain from exploiting the future bargaining advantage{\textendash}then the inefficiency would disappear. But spouses seldom can make binding commitments regarding allocation within marriage. To investigate the efficiency of bargaining within marriage when choices affect future bargaining power, we consider the location decisions of two-earner couples. Initial location decisions are transparent and analytically tractable examples of choices likely to affect future bargaining power, but the logic of our analysis applies to many other decisions. For example, decisions about education, fertility, and labor force participation are also potential sources of inefficiency.},

	abstract = {The intent of this book is to illuminate, under the critical light of epidemiology, the existing and evolving knowledge of prenatal development, through all of gestation from conception to birth. The book is divided into 5 sections: 1) disorders of development: weighing the evidence for environmental causes, 2) conception and early gestation, 3) later gestation, 4) age and parity, and 5) the physical environment, reproduction, and surveillance. The 1st section guides readers in evaluating observed associations between suspected teratogens and developmental outcomes. The authors discuss a number of established criteria by which the quality of causal inferences might be judged--time order, strength, consistency, specificity, and coherence. After laying this groundwork, the 2nd and 3rd sections draw an epidemiological map of development. The 2nd section devotes 3 consecutive chapters to the probabilities of conception and of loss, to the interpretation of frequency measures, and to actual frequencies observed. Another 3 chapters are devoted to miscarriage data in which normal and aberrant karyotypes have been differentiated. The 3rd section turns to fetal growth and its duration, preterm delivery, and existing concepts of fetal growth and birth weight. Section 4 explores 2 major issues in the analysis of reproductive outcomes, maternal age and gravidity. Section 5 takes up the public health challenge of detecting and controlling environmental hazards to reproduction, including a systematic analytic treatment of surveillance and the rationale for undertaking surveillance. - See more at: zotero://attachment/238/\#sthash.1Dl0W3n8.dpuf},

	abstract = {Objectives We explored death rates from all causes among victims of misdemeanor domestic violence 23 years after random assignment of their abusers to arrests vs. warnings. Methods We gathered state and national death data on all 1,125 victims (89 \% female; 70 \% African-American; mean age = 30) enrolled by Milwaukee Police in 1987{\textendash}88, after 98 \% treatment as randomly assigned. Results Victims were 64 \% more likely to have died of all causes if their partners were arrested and jailed than if warned and allowed to remain at home (p = .037, 95 \% CI = risk ratio of 1:1.024 to 1:2.628). Among the 791 African-American victims, arrest increased mortality by 98 \% (p = .019); among 334 white victims, arrest increased mortality by only 9 \% (95 \% CI = RR of 1:0.489 to 1:2.428). The highest victim death rate across four significant differences found in all 22 moderator tests was within the group of 192 African-American victims who held jobs: 11 \% died after partner arrests, but none after warnings (d = .8, p = .003). Murder of the victims caused only three of all 91 deaths; heart disease and other internal morbidity caused most victim deaths. Conclusions Partner arrests for domestic common assault apparently increased premature death for their victims, especially African-Americans. Victims who held jobs at the time of police response suffered the highest death rates, but only if they were African-American. Replications and detailed risk factor studies are needed to confirm these conclusions, which may support repeal or judicial invalidation of state-level mandatory arrest laws.},

Because abortions are favourably selected among pregnant teens, those miscarrying are less favourably selected than those giving birth or aborting but more favourably selected than those giving birth. Therefore, using miscarriage as an instrument is biased towards a benign view of teen motherhood, whereas ordinary least squares (OLS) on just those giving birth or miscarrying has the opposite bias. We derive a consistent estimator that reduces to a weighted average of OLS and IV when outcomes are independent of abortion timing. Estimated effects are generally adverse but modest.},

	abstract = {Objectives: Social capital has been linked to self rated health and mortality rates. The authors examined the relations between measures of social capital and male/female mortality rates across counties in Hungary.
Design: Cross sectional, ecological study.
Setting: 20 counties of Hungary.
Participants and methods: 12 640 people were interviewed in 1995 (the {\textquotedblleft}Hungarostudy II{\textquotedblright} survey), representing the Hungarian population according to sex, age, and county. Social capital was measured by three indicators: lack of social trust, reciprocity between citizens, and help received from civil organisations. Covariates included county GDP, personal income, education, unemployment, smoking, and alcohol spirit consumption.
Main outcome measure: Gender specific mortality rates were calculated for the middle aged population (45{\textendash}64 years) in the 20 counties of Hungary.
Results: All of the social capital variables were significantly associated with middle age mortality, but levels of mistrust showed the strongest association. Several gender differences were observed, namely male mortality rates were more closely associated with lack of help from civic organisations, while female mortality rates were more closely connected with perceptions of reciprocity.
Conclusion: There are gender differences in the relations of specific social capital indicators to mortality rates. At the same time, perceptions of social capital within each sex were associated with mortality rates in the opposite sex.},

We conducted a MEDLINE search for all English-language articles published between 1980 and 2007 with estimates of the relation between social factors and adult all-cause mortality. We calculated summary relative risk estimates of mortality, and we obtained and used prevalence estimates for each social factor to calculate the population-attributable fraction for each factor. We then calculated the number of deaths attributable to each social factor in the United States in 2000.Results. Approximately 245?000 deaths in the United States in 2000 were attributable to low education, 176?000 to racial segregation, 162?000 to low social support, 133?000 to individual-level poverty, 119?000 to income inequality, and 39?000 to area-level poverty.Conclusions. The estimated number of deaths attributable to social factors in the United States is comparable to the number attributed to pathophysiological and behavioral causes. These findings argue for a broader public health conceptualization of the causes of mortality and an expansive policy approach that considers how social factors can be addressed to improve the health of populations.},

Three major factors influence the actions of the abused wives: The less severe and less frequent the violence, the more a wife remained with her husband. Secondly, the more a wife was struck as a child by her parents, the more likely she was to remain with her abusive husband. Finally, the fewer resources a wife had and the less power she had the more likely she was to stay with her violent husband. In addition, external constraint influenced the actions of abused wives.

Women who had experienced conflict and/or violence in a close relationship with a man were recruited through public service announcements. One hundred and thirty women (78.3\% response rate) returned completed questionnaires assessing several variables, including characteristics of the abuse, positive aspects of their relationships, the use of downward comparisons, and attributions for positive behaviors and for the abuse. Forty-four (34.4\%) women were still involved in the abusive relationship, while 86 (65.6\%) were no longer involved with their abusive partner. Results of a discriminant function analysis suggest that women who remain with abusive partners appear to employ cognitive strategies that help them perceive their relationship in a positive light. For women still involved with their abusive partners, this positive relationship appraisal is unrelated to whether or not they have ever left their partners in the past. Moreover, it is unrelated to the frequency of moderate or severe physical abuse, but appears less likely the more frequently verbal abuse is experienced. In addition, women still involved with their abusive partners are not differentiated from those no longer involved in terms of their level of psychosocial adjustment. Our results suggest that it may be useful to adopt a stress and coping perspective and to view abusive relationships as a special class of close relationships in order to more fully understand the reasons why women may remain with their abusive partners.},

We found that many women do not seek criminal sanctions because sanctions are unlikely to help to end the violence. This calls into question the value, to victims, of mandatory arrest policies which require prosecution decisions to be based on evidential concerns alone. These policies are based (naively, we argue) on assumptions about the interests of victims. Policies which give effect to victim preferences are also naive in ignoring the circumstances which shape victim preferences. We therefore argue for an approach which would empower victims to make choices which are less coerced (by their circumstances) than is usual at present. Elements of this approach can be found in the practices of some domestic violence units.},

Forty of these studies indicated that children's exposure to domestic violence was related to emotional and behavioral problems, translating to a small overall effect (Z r = .28). Age, sex, and type of outcome were not significant moderators, most likely due to considerable heterogeneity within each of these groups. Co-occurrence of child abuse increased the level of emotional and behavioral problems above and beyond exposure alone, based on 4 available studies.

Combining data on intimate partner violence from the British Crime Survey with locally disaggregated labor market data from the UK{\textquoteright}s Annual Population Survey, we find strong evidence in support of the theoretical prediction.},

Also, education and income data from the United States Bureau of the Census and religiosity data from the Glenmary Research Center were used to assess the relation of education, median family income, and religiosity to the post-no-fault divorce rate. Results revealed that no-fault divorce law had a significant positive effect on the divorce rate across the 50 states. Of the moderators that we considered, median family income was the only significant predictor of the change in divorce rate; the adjusted post-no-fault divorce rate increased as median family income increased.},

Design~ A cross sectional study during a period after midwives had been trained to routinely enquire about it and a retrospective case note survey at an earlier period. Setting~ The maternity services of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Hospital Trust in South London. Sample~ Women aged 16 and over booking for maternity care between 14th September 1998 and 21st January 1999. Methods~ Midwives were required to routinely enquire about domestic violence at booking, 34 weeks of gestation and postpartum (within 10 days) using a series of structured questions. Main outcome measures~ The lifetime and annual rates of domestic violence. The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnancy. Results~ The prevalence of domestic violence in pregnancy was 1.8\% at booking, 5.8\% at 34 weeks of gestation and 5.0\% at 10 days postpartum. Eight hundred and ninety-two women were asked about domestic violence on at least one occasion, of whom 22 (2.5\%) reported domestic violence in pregnancy. Two hundred and sixty-five maternity notes were reviewed for the retrospective case note survey and one (0.37\%) case of domestic violence in pregnancy was identified. Routine questioning increased the rate of detection of domestic violence by 2.1\% (95\% CI = 0.1{\textendash}3.4\%; P= 0.03). The lifetime prevalence of domestic violence was 13\%, and 6.4\% in the previous 12 months. Conclusions~ Routine enquiry for domestic violence can increase the rate of detection in maternity settings, thereby providing an opportunity for women to access help early.},

	abstract = {Evidence from developed countries has linked family violence with severe acute malnutrition (SAM), yet no similar studies have been conducted in developing countries where the risk of SAM is higher. To redress this gap, the objective of this study was to explore the role of intimate partner violence (IPV) among caregivers as an independent risk factor for SAM. A hospital-based case{\textendash}control (n~=~172~:~345) study was carried out in six paediatric hospitals of Rio de Janeiro (1995{\textendash}99). Cases comprised children (1{\textendash}24~months) admitted with SAM (weight-for-height z-score {\textless} -2~SD). Controls were children of the same age admitted for non-traumatic surgery. Couple violence was gauged through the Conflict Tactics Scales from two perspectives: (a) two ordinal variables characterising the intensity of verbal and physical aggression based on scores, and (b) a four-level variable representing a pattern of increasing violence seriousness. Unconditional logistic regression analysis was performed to control for confounding factors. Parents of SAM cases had higher Conflict Tactics scores than parents of controls, indicating more severe partner violence. The adjusted odds ratio for the comparison of the highest to the lowest scores (10 vs. 0) was 4.15 (95\% confidence interval 1.55, 11.15). Using the four-level variable for violence seriousness, a threefold SAM risk was found for children with parents reporting severe physical abuse, but not for those with parents reporting verbal aggression or more minor physical assaults. In addition to traditionally studied risk factors, the findings suggest that family violence may also play an important role in SAM among children. Moreover, these findings indicate that the risk for SAM is not associated with all types of IPV, but that children exposed to severe and recurrent events are more likely to be admitted for SAM. For the prevention or early detection of SAM, this result points to a specific population group requiring rigorous public health targeting, especially in terms of accurate detection of both SAM and IPV, as well as appropriate handling and follow-up of violent families.},

	abstract = {Intimate partner violence (IPV) continues to be social problem in the United States. Unfortunately, legislation aimed at solving the problem has been based on models of IPV that are not empirically supported. One example is {\textquotedblleft}psychoeducational{\textquotedblright} intervention models legislated by the courts in many states. These models eschew psychological treatment even of empirically established factors supporting habits of intimate abusiveness. They have, in effect, removed a psychology of abusiveness from intervention and replaced it with a gender political model. In contrast to this model, research from several longitudinal peer cohort studies shows that a propensity for IPV is predictable in both genders during adolescence. Yet treatment or prevention of psychological risk factors is either neglected or negatively legislated. This paper reviews the prevailing criminal justice intervention model, provides examples of how the paradigm supporting this model distorts interpretation of research and compares this flawed research with methodologically superior studies suggesting a different and potentially more effective approach.},

Study design: The Severity of Violence Against Women scale (SVAW) was used to measure the frequency of threats and severity of physical and sexual abuse by means of a postal questionnaire covering a period of 8 weeks postpartum. In the sample of women the same research tool had been employed during the preceding pregnancy in the form of a personal interview. Results: The non-response rate was 75/207 (36\%) with a small difference in the rates of drop-out between women who had been abused or not abused during their pregnancy. Of the 132 women answering the questionnaire, 32 reported threats, physical or sexual abuse postpartum. Of those 32 women, 22 (69\%) stated that they had not been subject to abuse previously. Women who were abused postpartum were older and were married to a higher extent than those who had been abused prior to and during pregnancy. Conclusions: Abuse does not appear to be restricted to a specific socio-demographic group of women or to a specific period in a woman{\textquoteright}s reproductive life. Therefore, questions to women regarding both threats and physical violence should be part of all clinical practices.},

	abstract = {Background
Few population-based studies have assessed the physical and mental health consequences of both psychological and physical intimate partner violence (IPV) among women or men victims. This study estimated IPV prevalence by type (physical, sexual, and psychological) and associated physical and mental health consequences among women and men.
Methods
The study analyzed data from the National Violence Against Women Survey (NVAWS) of women and men aged 18 to 65. This random-digit-dial telephone survey included questions about violent victimization and health status indicators.
Results
A total of 28.9\% of 6790 women and 22.9\% of 7122 men had experienced physical, sexual, or psychological IPV during their lifetime. Women were significantly more likely than men to experience physical or sexual IPV (relative risk [RR]=2.2, 95\% confidence interval [CI]=2.1, 2.4) and abuse of power and control (RR=1.1, 95\% CI=1.0, 1.2), but less likely than men to report verbal abuse alone (RR=0.8, 95\% CI=0.7, 0.9). For both men and women, physical IPV victimization was associated with increased risk of current poor health; depressive symptoms; substance use; and developing a chronic disease, chronic mental illness, and injury. In general, abuse of power and control was more strongly associated with these health outcomes than was verbal abuse. When physical and psychological IPV scores were both included in logistic regression models, higher psychological IPV scores were more strongly associated with these health outcomes than were physical IPV scores.
Conclusions
Both physical and psychological IPV are associated with significant physical and mental health consequences for both male and female victims.},

	abstract = {Objective To test for any long-term effects on the death rates of domestic assault suspects due to arresting them versus warning them at the scene. Methods The Milwaukee Domestic Violence Experiment (MilDVE) employed a randomized experimental design with over 98 \% treatment as assigned. In 1987{\textendash}88, 1,200 cases with 1,128 suspects were randomly assigned to arrest or a warning in a 2:1 ratio. Arrested suspects were generally handcuffed and taken to a police station for about 3 to 12 h. Warned suspects were left at liberty at the scene after police read aloud a scripted statement. Death records were obtained in 2012{\textendash}13 from the Wisconsin Office of Vital Statistics and the Social Security Death Index, with the support of the Milwaukee Police Department. Results In the first presenting case in which the 1,128 were identified as suspects, they were randomly assigned to arrest in 756 cases and to a warning in 372. No clear difference in death rates from all causes combined (d = 0.04) was ever evident between the groups, or for five of the six specific categories of cause of death. However, a clear difference in homicide victimizations of the suspects emerged between those arrested and those warned. At 23 years after enrolment, suspects assigned to arrest were almost three times more likely to have died of homicide (at 2.25 \% of suspects) than suspects assigned to a warning (at 0.81 \%), a small to moderate effect size (d = 0.39) with marginal significance (two-tailed p = 0.096; relative risk ratio = 2.79:1; 90 \% CI = 1.0007 to 7.7696). Cox regressions controlling for suspects{\textquoteright} stakes in conformity (employment and marriage) show that homicide victimization for arrested suspects is three times that of warned suspects (p = 0.07), although no interactions are yet significant. Logistic regression with more covariates increases arrest effects on homicide to 3.2 times more than warnings (p = 0.06). Conclusions Suspects randomly assigned to arrest died from homicide at a consistently higher rate than controls over a two-decade period, but the difference was not statistically discernible until the 22nd year after assignment. Long-term follow-up of randomized experiments is essential for detecting mortality differences that substantially affect cost{\textendash}benefit analyses of criminal justice practices.},

	abstract = {A very simple technique has been used to shed light on a number of questions about the influence of economic level on national mortality trends and differentials. Scatter-diagrams of the cross-sectional relation between national income per head and life expectancy are developed for three decades during the twentieth, century. The relations established appear to shift systematically during the century. In general, in order to attain a certain life expectancy between 40 and 60 a nation requires an income level almost three times greater in the 1930s than in the 1960s This shift is corroborated by a changing structure of mortality by cause of death for populations at equivalent mortality levels. The magnitude of the shifts, combined with regional income data suggests that some 75{\textendash}90 per cent of the growth in life expectancy for the world as a whole over these three decades is attributable to factors exogenous to a nation's contemporary level of income Through similar techniques, improved nutrition and higher literacy can also be ruled out as important contributors. Nevertheless, the cross-sectional relation between income and life expectancy remains strong and there is some suggestion that mortality is now more responsive to variations in income levels among countries with national incomes below \$400 (1963 dollars) than it was in the 1930s However, population size appears to respond so slowly to the mortality declines that typically result irom income growth that these mortality effects present little impediment to the process of economic development. Some of the variability in the cross-sectional mortality-income relation is doubtless due to variation in income distributions. Life expectancy in Venezuela, Mexico, and Colombia, countries with wide disparities in incomes, falls short of levels expected on the basis of their mean incomes. On the other hand, life expectancy in Soviet-bloc countries, where income equality is expected to be greater than average, also falls short of expected levels. Western and non-Western countries alike profited from the activity of {\textquoteleft}exogenous{\textquoteright} medical and public health factors. Differences between the two types of countries have been exaggerated by concentration on movements between equivalent mortality levels rather than during equivalent time periods. Recent work in historical demography suggests that the importance in Western mortality trends of endogenous factors consequent to rising standards of living has been overstated for earlier periods as well.},

We analyze a novel dataset from three U.S. health clubs with information on both the contractual choice and the day-to-day attendance decisions of 7,752 members over three years. The observed consumer behavior is difficult to reconcile with standard preferences and beliefs. First, members who choose a contract with a flat monthly fee of over \$70 attend on average 4.3 times per month. They pay a price per expected visit of more than \$17, even though they could pay \$10 per visit using a 10-visit pass. On average, these users forgo savings of \$600 during their membership. Second, consumers who choose a monthly contract are 17 percent more likely to stay enrolled beyond one year than users committing for a year. This is surprising because monthly members pay higher fees for the option to cancel each month. We also document cancellation delays and attendance expectations, among other findings. Leading explanations for our findings are overconfidence about future self-control or about future efficiency. Overconfident agents overestimate attendance as well as the cancellation probability of automatically renewed contracts. Our results suggest that making inferences from observed contract choice under the rational expectation hypothesis can lead to biases in the estimation of consumer preferences.},

In this paper, a noncooperative model of domestic violence is presented. The comparative statics from this model predict that women's incomes and other financial support received from outside the marriage (family, welfare, shelters, divorce settlements, etc.) will decrease the level of violence in intact families because they increase the woman's threat point. Implications of the theoretical model are discussed and empirical evidence is summarized. The results from existing and new analysis provide support for the hypothesis that improved economic opportunities for women will decrease the level of violence in abusive re1ationships.},

	abstract = {Research Summary:  This research addresses the limitations of prior analyses and reviews of five experiments testing for the specific deterrent effect of arrest on intimate partner violence by applying to individual level data consistent eligibility criteria, common independent and outcome measures, and appropriate statistical tests. Based on 4,032 cases involving adult males who assaulted their female intimate partners, multivariate regression analyses show consistent but modest reductions in subsequent offenses targeting the original victim that is attributable to arresting the suspect. Although the reductions attributable to arrest are similar across all five studies, other factors, such as the suspect's prior arrest record, are stronger predictors of subsequent offenses. The effect of arrest is also modest compared with the general decline in offenses toward the same victim during the follow-up period. Policy Implications:  These results lend limited support for policies favoring arrest over informal police responses to intimate partner violence. However, the analyses also show that despite police intervention, a minority of suspects repeatedly victimize their partners and that factors other than formal sanctions play larger roles in explaining the cessation or continuation of aggressive behavior between intimates. These findings suggest that new policies replacing or enhancing arrest that target potential repeat offenders might produce larger reductions in intimate partner violence.},

This study analyzes assault and intimidation data from a calendar year 2000 National Incident Based Reporting System ("NIBRS") dataset that includes information from 2819 police departments in nineteen states. The study examines the differential arrest outcomes in intimate partner and other domestic, acquaintance, and stranger assaults, and the effect that the statutory framework has on the likelihood of arrest, with an added emphasis on female arrests. We found that mandatory and preferred arrest statutes have significant effects on arrest practices for intimate partner as well as other victim-offender relationship categories. The nature of the impact of laws varies depending upon offender and offense characteristics.},

Popular rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either to address or to explain adequately what would prevent leaders from locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two mechanisms can resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist terms. The first turns on the fact that states have both private information about capabilities and resolve and the incentive to misrepresent it. The second turns on the fact that in specific strategic contexts states may be unable credibly to commit to uphold a mutually preferable bargain.

	abstract = {SummaryBackground
There is widespread concern that the present economic crisis, particularly its effect on unemployment, will adversely affect population health. We investigated how economic changes have affected mortality rates over the past three decades and identified how governments might reduce adverse effects.
Methods
We used multivariate regression, correcting for population ageing, past mortality and employment trends, and country-specific differences in health-care infrastructure, to examine associations between changes in employment and mortality, and how associations were modified by different types of government expenditure for 26 European Union (EU) countries between 1970 and 2007.
Findings
We noted that every 1\% increase in unemployment was associated with a 0{\textperiodcentered}79\% rise in suicides at ages younger than 65 years (95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}16{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}42; 60{\textendash}550 potential excess deaths [mean 310] EU-wide), although the effect size was non-significant at all ages (0{\textperiodcentered}49\%, -0{\textperiodcentered}04 to 1{\textperiodcentered}02), and with a 0{\textperiodcentered}79\% rise in homicides (95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}06{\textendash}1{\textperiodcentered}52; 3{\textendash}80 potential excess deaths [mean 40] EU-wide). By contrast, road-traffic deaths decreased by 1{\textperiodcentered}39\% (0{\textperiodcentered}64{\textendash}2{\textperiodcentered}14; 290{\textendash}980 potential fewer deaths [mean 630] EU-wide). A more than 3\% increase in unemployment had a greater effect on suicides at ages younger than 65 years (4{\textperiodcentered}45\%, 95\% CI 0{\textperiodcentered}65{\textendash}8{\textperiodcentered}24; 250{\textendash}3220 potential excess deaths [mean 1740] EU-wide) and deaths from alcohol abuse (28{\textperiodcentered}0\%, 12{\textperiodcentered}30{\textendash}43{\textperiodcentered}70; 1550{\textendash}5490 potential excess deaths [mean 3500] EU-wide). We noted no consistent evidence across the EU that all-cause mortality rates increased when unemployment rose, although populations varied substantially in how sensitive mortality was to economic crises, depending partly on differences in social protection. Every US\$10 per person increased investment in active labour market programmes reduced the effect of unemployment on suicides by 0{\textperiodcentered}038\% (95\% CI -0{\textperiodcentered}004 to -0{\textperiodcentered}071).
Interpretation
Rises in unemployment are associated with significant short-term increases in premature deaths from intentional violence, while reducing traffic fatalities. Active labour market programmes that keep and reintegrate workers in jobs could mitigate some adverse health effects of economic downturns.

This article analyzes the relationship between participation in the labor force and the risk of spousal violence against women by treating employment as a symbolic, rather than simply socioeconomic resource. We begin with a latent class analysis that identifies qualitatively distinct patterns of violence against wives. We then examine direct and conditional effects of employment on women's risks of spousal violence. Our results show that the effect of a woman's employment on her risk of spousal violence is conditioned by the employment status of her partner. To some extent, these effects reflect efforts by men to coercively control their female partners.},

Also, the greater the number of spells of poverty, the higher the death rate. These data suggest that differential mortality rates by economic status are being confused with the well-known ethnic differences in mortality. An implication of this paper, therefore, is that ethnic differences in mortality are, in large part, a consequence of poverty or permanent low income, as opposed to genotype. Consequently, it may be just as valid, or even more so, to publish mortality tables by income as by race. A policy implication of this paper is that the redistributive effects of longevity-based transfer systems, such as social security (public pensions), may be less {\textquoteleft}progressive{\textquoteright} than has been assumed, since would-be poorer recipients are either less likely to live long enough to collect any benefits in the first place, or will not live to collect them for as long as more affluent recipients. In addition, I have failed to find a direct effect of schooling on probability of survival. Hence, the beneficial effect of schooling on longevity must work through its effect upon income, with only the latter directly influencing mortality risks.},

	abstract = {Bargaining at various levels has taken on a greater role in our understanding of international relations. Milner's (1997) work presented a model in which bargaining at the international level would result in the status quo advantaged actor getting his ideal agreement. We conducted a face-to-face experiment between sixty-eight pairings of men to test this prediction in a controlled setting. All of the participants were presented with the same bargaining problem in different contexts. For each pairing, we collected data on a trial bargaining period under a "classic" Nash bargaining problem (under private information, but without monetary incentive) and two bargaining periods with an underlying unidimensional issue space (i.e., Milner's model, once under private information, the other under full information, each with monetary incentive). While the Nash bargaining solution was consistently chosen under the "classic" Nash bargaining problem, it was rarely chosen when the bargaining problem represented an underlying unidimensional issue space. For the unidimension bargaining problem, private information did not facilitate producing any consistent outcome; under full information, the "equity point"-in which each participant earned the same dollar amount-was chosen significantly more often than any other outcome, even under a context in which the equity point was incentive incompatible for one actor to agree to that agreement. The overall results suggest that the Nash bargaining solution is predictive when it is also a focal point in the bargaining space, but is only prescriptive in a bargaining space with many mutually improving points. Finally, private information allowed the status quo advantaged actor to get a better deal compared to the full-information condition.},

Research among adults has shown that younger age is a consistent risk factor

epidemiologic studies of lifetime prevalence of dating violence among adolescents
have been conducted.Objective~To assess lifetime prevalence of physical and sexual violence from dating
partners among adolescent girls and associations of these forms of violence
with specific health risks.Design, Setting, and Participants~Female 9th through 12th-grade students who participated in the 1997
and 1999 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (n = 1977 and 2186, respectively).Main Outcome Measures~Lifetime prevalence rates of physical and sexual dating violence and
whether such violence is independently associated with substance use, unhealthy
weight control, sexual risk behavior, pregnancy, and suicidality.Results~Approximately 1 in 5 female students (20.2\% in 1997 and 18.0\% in 1999)
reported being physically and/or sexually abused by a dating partner. After
controlling for the effects of potentially confounding demographics and risk
behaviors, data from both surveys indicate that physical and sexual dating
violence against adolescent girls is associated with increased risk of substance
use (eg, cocaine use for 1997, odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95\% confidence interval
[CI], 2.3-9.6; for 1999, OR, 3.4; 95\% CI, 1.7-6.7), unhealthy weight control
behaviors (eg, use of laxatives and/or vomiting [for 1997, OR, 3.2; 95\% CI,
1.8-5.5; for 1999, OR, 3.7; 95\% CI, 2.2-6.5]), sexual risk behaviors (eg,
first intercourse before age 15 years [for 1997, OR, 8.2; 95\% CI, 5.1-13.4;
for 1999, OR, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.4-4.2]), pregnancy (for 1997, OR, 6.3; 95\% CI,
3.4-11.7; for 1999, OR, 3.9; 95\% CI, 1.9-7.8), and suicidality (eg, attempted
suicide [for 1997, OR, 7.6; 95\% CI, 4.7-12.3; for 1999, OR, 8.6; 95\% CI, 5.2-14.4]).Conclusion~Dating violence is extremely prevalent among this population, and adolescent
girls who report a history of experiencing dating violence are more likely
to exhibit other serious health risk behaviors.},

	abstract = {Violence against women is a major health and human rights problem yet there is little rigorous evidence as to how to reduce it. We take advantage of the randomized roll-out of Ecuador's cash transfer program to mothers to investigate how an exogenous increase in a woman's income affects domestic violence. We find that the effect of a cash transfer depends on a woman's education and on her education relative to her partner's. Our results show that for women with greater than primary school education a cash transfer significantly decreases psychological violence from her partner. For women with primary school education or less, however, the effect of a cash transfer depends on her education relative to her partner's. Specifically, the cash transfer significantly increases emotional violence in households where the woman's education is equal to or more than her partner's.},

	abstract = {Suicidal behaviours are one of the most important contributors to the global burden of disease among women, but little is known about prevalence and modifiable risk factors in low and middle income countries. We use data from the WHO multi-country study on women{\textquoteright}s health and domestic violence against women to examine the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts, and relationships between suicide attempts and mental health status, child sexual abuse, partner violence and other variables. Population representative cross-sectional household surveys were conducted from 2000{\textendash}2003 in 13 provincial (more rural) and city (urban) sites in Brazil, Ethiopia, Japan, Namibia, Peru, Samoa, Serbia, Thailand and Tanzania. 20967 women aged 15{\textendash}49 years participated. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts, lifetime suicidal thoughts, and suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks were calculated, and multivariate logistic regression models were fit to examine factors associated with suicide attempts in each site. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts ranged from 0.8\% (Tanzania) to 12.0\% (Peru city); lifetime thoughts of suicide from 7.2\% (Tanzania province) to 29.0\% (Peru province), and thoughts in the past four weeks from 1.9\% (Serbia) to 13.6\% (Peru province). 25{\textendash}50\% of women with suicidal thoughts in the past four weeks had also visited a health worker in that time. The most consistent risk factors for suicide attempts after adjusting for probable common mental health disorders were: intimate partner violence, non-partner physical violence, ever being divorced, separated or widowed, childhood sexual abuse and having a mother who had experienced intimate partner violence. Mental health policies and services must recognise the consistent relationship between violence and suicidality in women in low and middle income countries. Training health sector workers to recognize and respond to the consequences of violence may substantially reduce the health burden associated with suicidal behaviour.},

The resulting stochastic dynamical system is studied using techniques from statistical mechanics. The most likely states consist of patches where contractual terms are nearly uniform, separated by boundaries where the terms shift abruptly.

We demonstrate that the extent of domestic violence faced by women is not necessarily declining in their reservation utilities, or necessarily increasing in their spouses{\textquoteright}. Using the National Family Health Survey data of India for 1998{\textendash}99, we isolate the effect of domestic violence on female autonomy, taking into account the possible endogeneity of domestic violence through the choice of appropriate instruments. We provide some evidence for the evolutionary theory of domestic violence, which argues that such violence stems from the jealousy caused by paternity uncertainty in our evolutionary past. The findings have strong policy implications suggesting that it will take more than an improvement in women{\textquoteright}s employment options to address the problem of spousal violence.},

We also found that participant contacts with physicians declined, especially for mental health, and that more adolescents continued into grade 12.

Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Israel, including 49 interviews with battered women who found getting and/or being divorced difficult and dangerous, the author examined battered women's accounts of their experiences of the pluralistic and segregated family law system. She concludes that for battered women in Israel (Palestinians and Jews alike) the divorce process may be understood as part of or an extension of men's battering. With this analysis, the author illustrates the need to conduct locally specific, integrated domestic violence and divorce research.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore why Jordanian women stay with an abusive husband. Design: The study used a qualitative approach to collect data from 28 abused women who were recruited through their community during the summer and fall of 2007. Methods: Data were collected using an open-ended question through one-on-one in-depth interviews. Findings: Results from analysis of the qualitative data revealed that abused Jordanian women identified five main reasons for staying with an abusive husband: the inherited social background, financial dependency, lack of family support, sacrificing self for the sake of the children, and the adverse social consequences of divorce. Conclusions: The results indicate that Jordanian women are strongly bound by traditions and cultural rules and lack all means of empowerment. Results of the study have implications for healthcare providers, social workers, policy makers, and educators to enhance the health and social well-being of Arab Muslim women in Jordan. The findings may also apply to Arab families immigrating to the United States, Canada, and Europe who tend to bring their cultural beliefs, values, and norms, and may help healthcare professionals dealing with violence against women in these countries. Clinical Relevance: Healthcare professionals worldwide need to play an instrumental role in providing culture-specific and evidence-based care to empower women staying in abusive relationships, taking into consideration the influence of Arab Muslim culture.},

	abstract = {A very important contribution to the field of labor economics, and in particular to the understanding of the labor market forworkers with relatively low skill levels. I think we have the sense that the market looks bad, but haven't been clear on how bad it is, or how it got that way. What Employers Want provides some of the answers and identifies the important questions. It is essential reading. {\textemdash}Jeffrey S. Zax, University of Colorado at Boulder The substantial deterioration in employment and earnings among the nation's less-educated workers, especially minorities and younger males in the nation's big cities, has been tentatively ascribed to a variety of causes: an increase in required job skills, the movement of companies from the cities to the suburbs, and a rising unwillingness to hire minority job seekers. What Employers Want is the first book to replace conjecture about today's job market with first-hand information gleaned from employers about who gets hired. Drawn from asurvey of over 3,000 employers in four major metropolitan areas{\textemdash}Los Angeles, Boston, Atlanta, and Detroit{\textemdash}this volume provides a wealth of data on what jobs are available to the less-educated, in what industries, what skills they require, where they are located, what they pay, and how they are filled. The evidence points to a dramatic surge in suburban, white-collar jobs. The manufacturing industry{\textemdash}once a steady employer of blue-collar workers{\textemdash}has been eclipsed by the expanding retail trade and service industries, where the vast majority of jobs are in clerical, managerial, or sales positions. Since manufacturing establishments have been the most likely employers to move from the central cities to the suburbs, the shortage of jobs for low-skill urban workers is particularly acute. In the central cities, the problem is compounded and available jobs remain vacant because employers increasingly require greater cognitive and social skills as well as specific job-related experience. Holzer reveals the extent to which minorities are routinely excluded by employer recruitment and screening practices that rely heavily on testing, informal referrals, and stable work histories. The inaccessible location and discriminatory hiring patterns of suburban employers further limit the hiring of black males in particular, while earnings, especially for minority females, remain low. Proponents of welfare reform often assume that stricter work requirements and shorter eligibility periods will effectively channel welfare recipients toward steady employment and off federal subsidies. What Employers Want directly challenges this premise and demonstrates that only concerted efforts to close the gap between urban employers and inner city residents can produce healthy levels of employment in the nation's cities. Professor Holzer outlines the measures that will benecessary{\textemdash}targeted education and training programs, improved transportation and job placement, heightened enforcement of antidiscrimination laws, and aggressive job creation strategies. Repairing urban labor markets will not be easy. This book shows why. A Volume in the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality},

Reduced-form regressions of STD rates on state alcohol taxes for the years 1981{\textemdash}95 (with controls for state and year) indicate that a \$1 increase in the per-gallon liquor tax reduces gonorrhea rates by 2.1 percent, and a beer tax increase of \$.20 per six-pack reduces gonorrhea rates by 8.9 percent, with similar though more pronounced effects on syphilis rates. Quasi-experimental analysis of alcohol policy changes supports these findings and offers evidence that increases in the drinking age reduce STD rates among youth. The estimated external cost of alcohol-attributable STDs exceeds \$556 million annually, a factor that could be considered in determining optimal alcohol policy.},

The two basic assumptions are that each person tries to do as well as possible and that the "marriage market" is in equilibrium. With the aid of several additional simplifying assumptions, I derive a number of significant implications about behavior in this market. For example, the gain to a man and woman from marrying compared to remaining single is shown to depend positively on their incomes, human capital, and relative difference in wage rates. The theory also implies that men differing in physical capital, education or intelligence (aside from their effects on wage rates), height, race, or many other traits will tend to marry women with like values of these traits, whereas the correlation between mates for wage rates or for traits of men and women that are close substitutes in household production will tend to be negative. The theory does not take the division of output between mates as given, but rather derives it from the nature of the marriage market equilibrium. The division is determined here, as in other markets, by marginal productivities, and these are affected by the human and physical capital of different persons, sex ratios (that is, the relative numbers of men and women), and some other variables.},

Growing evidence suggests that the distribution of income{\textendash}in addition to the absolute standard of living enjoyed by the poor{\textendash}is a key determinant of population health. A large gap between rich people and poor people leads to higher mortality through the breakdown of social cohesion. The recent surge in income inequality in many countries has been accompanied by a marked increase in the residential concentration of poverty and affluence. Residential segregation diminishes the opportunities for social cohesion. Income inequality has spillover effects on society at large, including increased rates of crime and violence, impeded productivity and economic growth, and the impaired functioning of representative democracy. The extent of inequality in society is often a consequence of explicit policies and public choice. Reducing income inequality offers the prospect of greater social cohesiveness and better population health.},

Analyses used existing data collected by the Monitoring the Future project, an ongoing study involving annual, nationally representative surveys of high school seniors and annual follow-up surveys by mail of recent graduates. A separate, coordinated study used time-series analyses of official reports to examine effects of increases in the minimum drinking age in several states on rates of fatal crashes. Time-series results were compared with findings from self-report data. The major findings include: higher minimum drinking ages were associated with lower levels of alcohol use among high school seniors and recent high school graduates, even after multivariate controls; lower levels of alcohol use were observed across a number of demographic variables; the lower levels of use persisted into the early 20s, even after all respondents were of legal age; and lowered involvement in alcohol-related fatal crashes among drivers under 21 appeared due to lower alcohol consumption rates--in particular, less drinking in bars or taverns.},

	abstract = {We examine the interplay between social norms and the enforcement of laws. Agents choose a behavior (e.g., tax evasion, production of low-quality products, corruption, substance abuse, etc.) and then are randomly matched with another agent. An agent's payoff decreases with the mismatch between her behavior and her partner's, as well as average behavior in society. A law is an upper bound (cap) on behavior and a law-breaker, when detected, pays a fine and has her behavior forced down to the level of the law. Law-breaking depends on social norms because detection relies, at least in part, on private cooperation and whistle-blowing. Law-abiding agents have an incentive to whistle-blow because this reduces the mismatch with their partner's behavior as well as the overall negative externality. When laws are in conflict with norms so that many agents are breaking the law, each agent anticipates little whistle-blowing and is more likely to also break the law. Tighter laws (banning more behaviors) have counteracting effects, reducing behavior among law-abiding individuals but inducing more law-breaking. Greater fines for law breaking and better public enforcement reduce the number of law-breakers and behavior among law-abiding agents, but increase levels of law breaking among law-breakers (who effectively choose their behavior targeting other high-behavior law-breakers). Within a dynamic version of the model, we show that laws that are in strong conflict with prevailing social norms may backfire, while gradual tightening of laws can be more effective by changing social norms.},

The aim of this study was to describe mortality among a cohort of homeless adults and adjust for the effects of morbidity and socio-economic deprivation.Methods Retrospective 5-year study of two fixed cohorts, homeless adults and an age- and sex-matched random sample of the local non-homeless population in Greater Glasgow National Health Service Board area for comparison.Results Over 5 years of observation, 1.7\% (209/12 451) of the general population and 7.2\% (457/6323) of the homeless cohort died. The hazard ratio of all-cause mortality in homeless compared with non-homeless cohorts was 4.4 (95\% CI: 3.8{\textendash}5.2). After adjustment for age, sex and previous hospitalization, homelessness was associated with an all-cause mortality hazard ratio of 1.6 (95\% CI: 1.3{\textendash}1.9). Homelessness had differential effects on cause-specific mortality. Among patients who had been hospitalized for drug-related conditions, the homeless cohort experienced a 7-fold increase in risk of death from drugs compared with the general population.Conclusions Homelessness is an independent risk factor for deaths from specific causes. Preventive programmes might be most effectively targeted at the homeless with these conditions.},

	abstract = {Background: Homeless people suffer from high levels of morbidity and mortality, but there is surprisingly little empiric evidence that homelessness has a direct adverse effect on health. Methods: This study examined the relationship between shelter use and risk of death using longitudinal data in a cohort of 8,769 homeless men in Toronto, Ontario. Shelter use was modelled as a time-dependent covariate in a Cox regression analysis. Results: In a model adjusted for age and previous pattern of homelessness, the risk of death during months in which homeless shelters were used was significantly increased (hazard ratio, 1.84; 95\% confidence interval, 1.27-2.67). Conclusions: Among men, periods of homeless shelter use are associated with higher mortality. There are three reasons why this finding does not necessarily mean that homelessness itself increases the risk of death. First, the hazard of death associated with shelter use compared to non-shelter use may be significantly different from that associated with homelessness compared to non-homelessness. Second, the association between shelter use and risk of death may be confounded by other variables such as alcohol and drug use. Finally, because the mechanism and time-course of the putative effect of homelessness on health is uncertain, appropriate modelling of the time-dependent covariate is difficult to ensure. Further research into the possible adverse effects of homelessness on health is needed and would have important implications for public policy. Contexte : Les sans-abri pr{\'e}sentent des taux de morbidit{\'e} et de mortalit{\'e} {\'e}lev{\'e}s, mais les preuves empiriques des effets ind{\'e}sirables de la clochardise sur la sant{\'e} sont {\'e}tonnamment rares. M{\'e}thode : {\`A} l'aide de donn{\'e}es longitudinales, nous avons {\'e}tudi{\'e} le lien entre l'h{\'e}bergement en maison pour sans-abri et le risque de d{\'e}c{\`e}s dans une cohorte de 8 769 hommes sans abri {\`a} Toronto (Ontario). L'h{\'e}bergement en maison pour sans-abri a {\'e}t{\'e} mod{\'e}lis{\'e} comme covariable chronologique d'une analyse de r{\'e}gression de type Cox. R{\'e}sultats : Selon notre mod{\`e}le, ajust{\'e} selon l'{\^a}ge et les {\'e}pisodes ant{\'e}rieurs de clochardise, le risque de d{\'e}c{\`e}s durant les mois d'h{\'e}bergement en maison pour sans-abri pr{\'e}sentait une hausse significative (coefficient de risque : 1,84; intervalle de confiance de 95 \% = 1,27-2,67). Conclusions : Chez les hommes, les p{\'e}riodes d'h{\'e}bergement en maison pour sans-abri sont associ{\'e}es {\`a} un taux de mortalit{\'e} sup{\'e}rieur. Mais pour trois raisons, cette constatation ne signifie pas n{\'e}cessairement que la clochardise accro{\^i}t en soi le risque de d{\'e}c{\`e}s. Premi{\`e}rement, le risque associ{\'e} {\`a} l'h{\'e}bergement en maison pour sans-abri, par comparaison avec le non-h{\'e}bergement dans ces maisons, peut diff{\'e}rer de mani{\`e}re significative du risque associ{\'e} {\`a} la clochardise par comparaison avec la non-clochardise. Deuxi{\`e}mement, d'autres variables, comme la consommation d'alcool et de drogues, peuvent brouiller l'association entre l'h{\'e}bergement en maison pour sansabri et le risque de d{\'e}c{\`e}s. Troisi{\`e}mement, comme on ignore le m{\'e}canisme et l'{\'e}volution dans le temps de l'effet pr{\'e}sum{\'e} de la clochardise sur la sant{\'e}, il est difficile de mod{\'e}liser convenablement la covariable chronologique. Il faudrait pousser la recherche sur les {\'e}ventuels effets ind{\'e}sirables de la clochardise sur la sant{\'e}, ce qui aurait d'importantes incidences sur les politiques gouvernementales.},

The paucity of prosecutorial and court response to intimate partner violence is considered one of the inadequacies of the justice system, an indicator of society's inattentiveness to violence against women, and another reason to question the criminal justice system's ability to successfully address violence between intimate partners. Our review of 135 English language studies leads us to challenge the widely accepted notion that prosecution and conviction for this offense are infrequent. There is great variability in the reported rates of prosecution and conviction for intimate partner violence. These studies report that, on average, about one third of the reported offenses and more than three fifths of arrests result in the filing of charges; more than half of all prosecutions result in a criminal conviction.},

We exploit cross-cohort variation in the prevalence of teacher strikes within and across provinces in Argentina in a difference-in-difference framework to examine how exposure to teacher strikes during primary school affects long-run outcomes. We find robust evidence that teacher strikes worsen the labor market outcomes of these individuals when they are between the ages of 30 and 40: being exposed to the average incidence of teacher strikes during primary school (88 days) reduces annual labor market earnings by 2.99 percent. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that this amounts to an aggregate earnings loss of \$712 million in Argentina annually. This is equivalent to the cost of raising the average annual employment income of all primary school teachers in Argentina by 19 percent. We also find evidence of a decline in hourly wage, an increase in unemployment, an increase in the probability of not working or studying and a decline in the skill levels of the occupations into which students sort. Examining short- and long-run educational outcomes suggests that the labor market effects are driven, at least in part, by a reduction in educational attainment. Our analysis further identifies significant intergenerational treatment effects. Children of adults who were exposed to teacher strikes during primary school also experience adverse educational attainment effects.},

We review important methodological improvements in the identiﬁcation of union impacts and the measurement of contract restrictiveness that characterize a number of recent studies. We generally ﬁnd that the preponderance of empirical evidence suggests that teacher unionization and union strength are associated with increases in district expenditures and teacher salaries, particularly salaries for experienced teachers. The evidence for union-related differences in student outcomes is mixed, but suggestive of insigniﬁcant or modestly negative union effects. Taken together, these patterns are consistent with a rent-seeking hypothesis. We conclude by discussing other important union activities, most notably in the political arena, and by noting that recent changes in state laws pertaining to teachers and teacher unions may provide context for new directions in scholarship.},

Our identiﬁcation strategy exploits the fact that 33 states mandate collective bargaining while 5 states prohibited it. In states that mandate collective bargaining, we ﬁnd that beginning salaries and the premium paid to experienced teachers increase with district size while the teacher–pupil ratio declines with district size. In contrast, in states that prohibit collective bargaining we ﬁnd a negative relationship between district size and the premium paid to experienced teachers. District size also has a stronger positive effect on beginning salaries and a weaker negative effect on teacher–pupil ratios in states that prohibit collective bargaining. Collectively, our results suggest that more powerful unions bargain for more generous returns to teacher seniority at the expense of stafﬁng ratios and base salaries.},

	abstract = {Speculative literature on the topic of teacher collective bargaining has suggested that increased teacher compensation gains resulting from bargaining may require school officials to reduce expenditures in nonteacher compensation categories and/or expand the size of the operating budget in order to locate necessary funds to finance higher total teacher compensation costs. In order to examine the relationship between collective bargaining and school district expenditure patterns, an empirical study of the operating budgets of a total of 133 bargaining and non-bargaining districts in the State of Illinois was conducted. For purposes of examining the relationship between bargaining activity and expenditure levels under varying economic constraints, the sample was segmented on the basis of school district wealth. Data pertaining to total operating expenditures, teacher compensation costs, and eleven nonteacher expenditure categories of the budget were derived from the Annual Financial Reports of the school districts being analyzed. A regression approach was utilized to control for various economic and demographic variables that, in addition to collective bargaining, could affect expenditure levels. The results showed that collective bargaining is significantly related to higher expenditure levels per ADA for total teacher compensation in all three wealth groups. The speculated effect that bargaining is related to lower expenditures in nonteacher expenditure areas of the budget was also shown to be systematically related to district wealth. Further analysis indicated that collective bargaining is significantly related to higher school district taxation levels, thus suggesting that bargaining activity within a district exerts pressure on school officials to expand the size of the district's operating budget regardless of district wealth.},

The teachers' unions at the state and national levels contribute a great deal of money to candidates for state and federal ofﬁces. This gives the unions some inﬂuence in passing (defeating) bills that would help (harm) the state's teachers. We introduce two novel measures of the strength of the state-wide teachers union: union dues per teacher and union expenditures per student. These reﬂect the key role of political inﬂuence for state-wide unions. We provide remarkably strong evidence that students in states with strong teachers unions have lower proﬁciency rates than students in states with weak state-wide teacher unions.},

In this article, Lala Carr Steelman, Brian Powell, and Robert Carini examine the question, "Do teacher unions hinder educational performance?" Focusing on two of the best-known standardized tests, the Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) and the American College Test (ACT), the authors examine whether interstate variation in standardized test performance is negatively linked to interstate variation in teacher unions. They find a significant and positive relationship: that is, the presence of teacher unions appears to be linked to stronger state performance on these exams. These findings challenge the position that teacher unions depress student academic performance, and in so doing invite further empirical scholarship on this topic from a range of academic disciplines.},

Using administrative data from North Carolina public schools, this paper jointly estimates the effect of absences and length of the school calendar on test score performance. We exploit a state policy that provides variation in the number of school days prior to standardized testing and ﬁnd substantial differences between these two effects. Extending the school calendar by ten days increases math and reading test scores by only 1.7\% and 0.8\% of a standard deviation, respectively. A similar reduction in absences would lead to gains of 5.5\% in math and 2.9\% in reading. We perform a number of robustness checks including utilizing ﬂu data to instrument for absences, family-year ﬁxed effects, distinguishing between excused and unexcused absences, and controlling for a contemporaneous measure of student disengagement. Our results are robust to these alternative speciﬁcations. In addition, our ﬁndings indicate considerable heterogeneity across student ability, suggesting that targeting absenteeism among low performing students could aid in narrowing current gaps in performance.},

Moreover, we find considerable heterogeneity in the effectiveness of instructional time across ability-related tracks, with the more able students benefitting more. Additional instruction time increases the within-school variance of subject-specific test scores, indicating an increase in educational inequality.},

We explore this question using data on math and reading assessments taken by students in the third, ﬁfth, and eighth grades since 994 in Maryland. Our identiﬁcation strategy is rooted in the fact that tests are administered on the same day(s) statewide in late winter or early spring, so any unscheduled closings due to snow reduce instruction time and are not made up until after the exams are over. We estimate that in academic years with an average number of unscheduled closures (ﬁve), the number of third graders performing satisfactorily on state reading and math assessments within a school is nearly 3 percent lower than in years with no school closings. The impacts of closure are smaller for students in ﬁfth and eighth grades. Combining our estimates with actual patterns of unscheduled closings in the last three years, we ﬁnd that more than half of schools failing to make adequate yearly progress (AYP) in third-grade math or reading, required under No Child Left Behind, would have met AYP if schools had been open on all scheduled days.},

Weather-related cancellations are made up at the end of school years, allowing relatively large ‡uctuations in instructional days within school districts prior to test administration. Because school cancellations are not recorded for past school years, this data limitation is overcome by using two-sample indirect least squares. The second identi…cation strategy takes advantage of state-mandated changes in test-date administration in Minnesota, which moved 5 times in 5 years. The results are similar for either source of instructional day variation: more instructional time prior to test administration increases student performance. The e¤ects are consistent across various thresholds of performance and grade levels.},

I use a 2001 Wisconsin state law that restricted districts to start dates after September 1st to identify the effects of this extra time on student achievement. Extra classroom days are associated with small increases in Math scores for 4th graders, but not average reading or language scores.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing trend for school districts to switch from a traditional ﬁve-day school week to a four-day week schedule with lengthened hours. While this shift to a shorter school week potentially helps school districts cut costs, there may be implications for student achievement, which this paper considers. This study uses a diﬀerence-in-diﬀerences analysis using a panel data set of student-level test scores to examine the eﬀects of the adoption of these four-day school weeks on student achievement in Oregon. I generally ﬁnd that student achievement declines following the switch to a four-day school week, as math test scores fall by around one-tenth of a standard deviation and fewer students are likely to meet proﬁciency targets. Looking at diﬀerential eﬀects across student groups, minority, low-income, and special education students seem to be the most aﬀected by these policies, possibly exacerbating pre-existing achievement gaps in these districts. The event study results suggest, however, that these eﬀects are largely transitory and by four years after the policy is introduced the average student is scoring at the same level they were prior to the policy. One potential mechanism for these eﬀects, appears to be the early start times associated with longer school days under a four day school week schedule.},

This article develops some methods for using multiwave panel data to estimate the effects of either naturally occurring events or planned interventions. It does this by synthesizing the literature on interrupted time series with econometric treatments of pooled time-series, cross-section data. The emphasis is on fixed-effects models and estimators because of their capacity to control for all stable differences across individuals, whether or not those differences are correlated with measured variables. In contrast to earlier treatments of the problem, the models allow for timevarying covariates and for events that can occur at different time periods for different individuals. For continuous dependent variables, the basic estimators are easily obtained with standard OLS regression programs. For dichotomous outcomes, logit models can be estimated by the method of conditional likelihood.},

It has therefore become very popular to use “clustered” standard errors, which are robust against arbitrary patterns of within-cluster variation and covariation. Conventional methods for inference using clustered standard errors work very well when the model is correct and the data satisfy certain conditions, but they can produce very misleading results in other cases.

This approximation is analogous to ‘ﬁxed-b’ asymptotics of Kiefer and Vogelsang (2002, 2005) (KV) for heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent inference, but in our case yields standard t and F distributions where the number of groups essentially plays the role of sample size.

	abstract = {For over 20 years, educators and administrators across North America have heatedly debated the value of large-scale student assessment. Throughout the history of schooling in British Columbia, large-scale student assessment outcomes have traditionally served to inform broader societal goals. Realistically, "assessment of" group learning (as opposed to classroom-based "assessment for" individual learning) will continue as the government’s key focus. We also raise several unanswered questions such as the scope of assessment practices that include only numeracy and literacy or the achievement of elementary versus secondary students between 1976 and 1999, questions to move the decades-old debate beyond its current stalemate.},

	abstract = {Behavioral economic analyses recently have been extended to alcohol drinking among college students. The current study used a hypothetical alcohol purchase task (APT) to assess the effects of academic constraints (next-day class time and next-day class requirement) on alcohol demand among college students. Participants were asked to read a description of a drinking scenario and indicate how many standard drinks they would consume at a variety of prices. In Experiment 1, 164 participants (71\% female) were randomly assigned to one of three “academic constraint” conditions, for which the scenario included a next-day class that differed by scheduled time (8:30 a.m., 10:00 a.m., or 12:30 p.m.), or a control condition (no next-day class). Exponential demand analyses revealed that participants in all three of the academic constraint conditions reported fewer drinks consumed and displayed lower “essential value” of alcohol, or greater sensitivity to price increases, compared with the no-constraint control. In Experiment 2, 66 participants (80.3\% female) were randomly divided into four groups and received one of four versions of the APT, manipulated to examine class time and class requirement (8:30 a.m. class, 8:30 a.m. exam, 12:30 p.m. class, 12:30 p.m. exam). Exponential demand analyses revealed that the essential value of alcohol was lower for the two 8:30 a.m. conditions compared with the 12:30 p.m. conditions and was lowest for participants in the 8:30 a.m. exam condition compared with the other three. These results suggest that academic requirements may reduce alcohol demand among college students.},

	abstract = {This analysis describes changes in assumptions about beverage alcohol use as a major cause of liver cirrhosis since the turn of the century. The findings reveal that social and political views shaped by the temperance movement. Repeal era and modem alcoholism movement have had a profound impact on medical and public health interpretations of the role of alcohol use in liver disease. Current clinical and epidemiological approaches that stress the importance of alcohol as a direct etiological agent for liver cirrhosis were popular during the 19th century in the wake of the temperance and prohibition movements, but were greatly modified to attribute a secondary role to alcohol use as a cause of cirrhosis during the Repeal and post-World War II eras. The changes during the Repeal and post-World War II eras coincided with the expansion of alcohol consumption and the liberalization of drinking norms in US society. As a result, the role of alcohol in causing cirrhosis among the general population was minimized and the disease was attributed to industrial toxins and air pollution. Contemporary research has affirmed the importance of beverage alcohol as a causal agent of liver cirrhosis using both clinical and epidemiological studies.},

A signal reveals information on the number of seats available at the posted price. Consumers can use this information to optimally time when they purchase a ticket. The maximum increase in expected utility for a naive consumer, who does not use publicly available information, is 8\%. For a sophisticated consumer, the increase is between 4–7\%.

	abstract = {Increasingly, arrest appears to be the disposition of choice for combatting violence between intimate partners. However, the ramifications of such policies may differentially impact on female victims, particularly those battered women with fewer resources and alternatives who have traditionally placed a greater reliance on police intervention. The residual effects of pro-arrest policies may operate subtly, becoming indiscernible through quantitative analyses of follow-up data and emerging only when qualitative methodologies are employed in conjunction with quantitative methodologies. Although pro-arrest policies are one way to attack the problem of woman battering, the policies become problematic if they disproportionately affect women from minority and lower socio-economic groups, facilitating negative consequences, including possible reoccurrences of violence. This paper raises some of the pertinent issues involved when research fails to capture or address the potential implications of pro-arrest strategies once implemented, and suggests ways to explore the extent and ramifications of these effects.},

Are those who opt out trying to protect their children, or do they have broader political aims? These are some of the questions that we aim to address in this study. Data for this study come from the National Survey on Opting Out, which was conducted from January 20, 2016 through March 31, 2016. We recruited respondents online, through links on the webpages and social media channels of opt out groups. The survey was administered electronically.
