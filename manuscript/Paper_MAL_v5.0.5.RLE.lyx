\begin_layout Abstract
From the late 1970s into the 1990s, 20 states in the USA passed 'mandatory
 arrest laws', designed to curb domestic violence, by requiring the responding
 officer to arrest the offender.
 I show that these laws led to an increase in the mortality rates of African-Ame
rican women.
 The increase takes place three to five years after the law has been passed
 and loses its statistical significance as time passes.
 I infer from these results that mandatory arrest laws had unintended consequenc
es for the victims whose partners were arrested, but that these unintended
 consequences impacted the victims only in the few years following the law.
 I conclude that increased awareness of the law and offender deterrence
 eventually mitigates these unintended consequences.

\begin_layout Standard
In the current paper, I present evidence that mandatory arrest laws, intended
 to protect victims of domestic violence, led to a temporary increase in
 the mortality rates of African-American women.
 While this result may seem unexpected at first, prior literature suggests
 that such an outcome is possible: in an experimental setting, African-American
 victims were twice as likely to be dead after 23 years if their offending
 partners are arrested 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "sherman2014increased"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 If arresting a domestic violence offender can unintentionally increase
 the probability of death for a victim, then mandating arrest as a policy
 for domestic violence can also unintentionally increase mortality rates
 of African-American women.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main purpose and contribution of this paper is to estimate the impact
 of mandatory arrest laws on mortality rates of African-American women.
 For this purpose, I construct a data set of yearly mortality rates by state,
 gender and race.
 Results from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sherman2014increased"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 suggest that victim mortality increases with partner arrest, but this result
 is limited to an experimental setting where the deterrence effects of the
 new law are non-existent or limited: offenders were not aware that their
 actions could lead to an arrest, and could not have been deterred from
 committing violence in the first place.
 Outside of the experiment, once the mandatory arrest laws are passed and
 known by the population, potential offenders can be deterred from offending
 in the first place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the identification of effects, I exploit the variation in the timing
 of the passing of the mandatory arrest laws.
 For this purpose, I use two empirical specifications: a difference-in-differenc
es model and a fixed effects model.
 The difference-in-differences model is the standard approach in identifying
 causal impacts.
 Fixed effects models are a generalization of the difference-in-differences
 models and have been used in difference-in-differences settings.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lovenheim_long-run_2019,anderson_does_2015,huebener_compressing_2017"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 With the fixed effects model in the current paper, I am able control for
 state-specific confounding factors, and confounding factors specific to
 each year.
 Furthermore, I am able to control for linear time trends peculiar to each
 state, as suggested by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "angrist_mostly_2008"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Furthermore, with the fixed-effects model, I am able to estimate the timing
 of the impact.
 In both specifications, I find a statistically significant increase in
 mortality rates of African-American women.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main identification assumption for the difference-in-differences model
 requires mortality rates in control and mandatory to follow similar trends.
 I present the trends in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 The identification assumption for the fixed effects model requires the
 timing of the laws to be independent of confounding factors and the outcome
 variable.
 These confounding factors may come from data that is not observed or collected.
 To control for the unobserved confounding factors that are specific to
 a state, state-fixed controls are included in the model, and to control
 for the confounding factors that are common across all states but vary
 over time, year-fixed controls are included.
 What remains are factors that may be correlated to a particular timing
 of the law passing in a given state.
 In the current setting, it was nation-wide events, and not state-specific
 triggers, that led to the passing of the laws 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "iyengar2009doesthe,buzawa1996doarrests"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This increases my confidence that the identification assumptions are met.
 In spite of this, I also include state-year economic, demographic and political
 controls, as well as state-specific linear time trends.
 The results remain statistically significant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper has two main results: mandatory arrest laws led to an unintentional
 increase in the mortality rates of African-American women, and this increase
 was temporary.
 I interpret these results as the consequence of deterrence of partners
 by mandatory arrest.
 The mandatory arrest laws created unintended consequences for the victims
 in the first couple of years after they were passed, but in the following
 years, they helped the victims by deterring the offenders, an effect that
 was not captured in the experimental setting by

 evidence that passing mandatory or recommended arrest laws increases mortality
 rates of African-American women, a population at-risk of domestic violence.

\begin_layout Standard
At first, it seems intuitive that mandatory arrest laws should not

 victim mortality rates: mandatory arrest laws are aimed at protecting the
 victims, either by removing the offender from the scene, or by deterring

 discuss possible causal pathways that could explain this unexpected increase
 in mortality, but they do not bring evidence on any particular pathways.
 Given that their results are driven by African-American women, it is possible
 that potential racialized applications of the law by police departments
 may have played a role.

 speculate that an

 may explain the causal pathway that leads to the victim's death.
 They note that the increase in mortality was attributable to African-American
 female victims, and that employed victims and victims with partners who
 had no prior arrest were impacted the most.
 Possibly, the probability of death of a victim might be increasing due
 to the loss of a job right after the incident.
 Alternatively, the loss of a job of a partner may have a similar impact.

 show that a criminal record decreases employment opportunities.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Domestic violence is a particular type of crime where the interaction of
 the victim and the offender can continue after an arrest or a prosecution.
 As such, victims can be impacted indirectly by the loss of income opportunities
 of the offender.
 For example, alimony payments to a victim may decrease if the offender
 faces a decrease in their income.
 Such a pathway would be in parallel with microeconomic theory: because
 members of a household may benefit from pooled resources, loss of resources
 of the offender may impact the victim.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The results from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sherman2014increased"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 motivate the need to focus on African-American women.
 This is perhaps expected: women are the primary victims of more physical
 and criminal forms of domestic violence, and African-American women are
 particularly at risk 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "farmer2003explaining,aizer2010thegender"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 However, African-American men, white women, and white men may also be impacted
 by mandatory arrest laws.
 How these groups are impacted can present evidence about the causal pathway.
 In particular, if the causal pathway to mortality is mainly through the
 interaction of arrest and loss of employment opportunities, I would expect
 to see an increase in the mortality rates of all four groups: African-Americans
 and whites, and both genders.
 These groups can be impacted through the loss of resources related to employmen
t whether they are offenders or victims.
 Conversely, if racialized applications of the law play an important role,
 I would expect to see an impact on African-American women and men, but
 not white men and women.
 How much the consequences of arrest can be transferred to the victim can
 also show up on the data.
 If the mortality rates of women increase, this serves as evidence that
 the law is impacting women, even though they are less likely to be offenders
 of domestic violence.
 If the mortality rates of women and men increase by similar amounts, this
 would serve as evidence that both offenders are victims are likely to be
 impacted by the law.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The randomized experiment in MilDVE was designed in the following manner:
 first, a domestic violence incident needs to take place, and the victim
 needs to call the department.
 Once an offender and a victim unknowingly choose to be part of the experiment,
 the police department made sure that they met the eligibility criteria:
 the offense had to be a misdemeanor, so more serious offenses that involved
 injury to the parties would not be included in the randomization.
 Furthermore, the responding police officer had to have probable cause that
 the offense occurred recently.
 After these two criteria were met, the treatment (arrest) would be assigned
 randomly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are certain difficulties with this design: first, the offender is
 unaware of the ongoing experiment, so they do not have a chance of being
 deterred from the act of violence by the threat of arrest.
 For this reason, the randomized experiments were able to test reductions
 only in repetition of the offense.
 Reductions in potential domestic violence in the overall population are
 not easy to test through randomized design.
 Furthermore, the design applied to only offenses that are not serious enough
 to always warrant an arrest.
 Arguably, arrests of spouses could be more beneficial and less harmful
 to the victim when the underlying offense is more serious.
 Finally, the researchers themselves suspected that police officers may
 have subverted the experiment where they felt that the given experimental
 treatment was inappropriate.
 All of these measures point to a situation where the results could be biased
 due to attrition from the experiment, or due to subversion

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Typically, mortality rates of African-American women follow similar trends
 in mandatory and discretionary arrest law states.
 In the current paper, I present evidence that mortality rates for African-Ameri
can women deviate from their trends in two to four years after the mandatory
 arrest laws were passed.
 With the quasi-experimental design in the current study, I estimate the
 impact of mandating a treatment on an entire population, rather than a
 particular subsample.
 This allows me to overcome the challenges faced by the researchers in experimen
t design.
 Most importantly, the impact of deterrence of the first domestic violence
 incident is not possible to capture in this randomized experiment design.
 In addition, the situations with more serious offenses are not even in
 the experiment.
 Finally, the experiment design suffers from the possibility of subversion,
 an issue that the authors themselves noticed.
 Mortality rates of entire state populations do not suffer from these issues,
 and the variation in the timing of the arrest laws create a quasi-experimental
 setting, which I exploit to overcome the difficulties from the original
 experiment.

\begin_layout Standard
To identify the effect of mandatory and recommended arrest laws on the mortality
 rates of African-American women, I exploit the fact that the laws passed
 in different years in different states.
 For identification, I employ a difference-in-differences strategy and implement
 this strategy in two baseline models.
 The first model is the classic difference-in-differences model:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{s,t}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}T_{s,t}+\beta_{2}T_{s}+\beta_{3}T_{t}+\epsilon_{s,t}\label{eq:did-model}

 is the coefficient of interest.Correspondingly, 
\begin_inset ERT

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ T_{s,t} $
\end_layout

\end_inset

 is a binary variable that takes the value 1 if a state 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$s$
\end_layout

\end_inset

 has already passed the mandatory or recommended arrest law passed in a
 given year 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$t$
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 The binary variable 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ T_s $
\end_layout

\end_inset

 takes the value 1 if a state 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\end_layout

\end_inset

 ever passes a mandatory or recommended arrest law.
 The binary variable 
\begin_inset ERT
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

$ T_t $
\end_layout

\end_inset

 takes the value 0 in the years before the passing of an arrest law, and
 the value 1 in the years after passing of an arrest law, for all states.
 The setting is different from a traditional difference-in-differences setting
 in the sense that before and after are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

staggered
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, or different for each state.
 Because mortality rates are not stable over time, I only include four years
 before and after the law passing.
\begin_inset Foot
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Changing this figure to 2, 3 or 5 does not impact the sign or statistical
 significance of the results from the difference-in-differences estimation
 for the African-American women, while changing to 1 makes the results statistic
ally insignificant at the usual levels of confidence.
\end_layout

\end_inset

 Following advice from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "bertrand2003howmuch"
literal "false"

\end_inset

on ignoring time series information, I pool the years before and after the
 treatment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the difference-in-differences model, to identify the causal impact of
 the arrest laws, the states need to follow parallel trends overall.
 These trends are presented in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:trends"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

.
 Overall, trends in mortality rates of African-American women follow similar
 paths in different states.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The second model is a fixed-effects model.
 This allows me to exploit the variation in passing of the laws across states
 and over time by including state-fixed effects and year-fixed effects.
 This model controls for everything that the difference-in-differences model
 controls for, but allows the states to vary in their unobserved characteristics.
 It also allows me to control for unobserved characteristics specific to
 each year.
 The baseline estimation equation is:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
y_{s,t}=\beta_{m}M_{s,t}+\psi X_{s,t}+\alpha_{s}+\lambda_{t}+\epsilon_{s,t}\label{eq:static-model}

\begin_layout Standard
Using the model in Equation 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:static-model"

\end_inset

, I am able to control for state-specific and year-specific unobservables
 using state- and year-fixed effects.
 It is important to control for year-specific unobservables for two reasons.
 First, mortality rates for African-American women show a downward trend.
 Year-fixed binary variables control for this trend.
 Second, a number of nationwide policies may have affected mortality rates
 and domestic violence rates during this period.
 Notably, the African-American mortality rates may be affected by tough-on-crime
 measures such as the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, and domestic violence
 rates may have been affected by the Violence Against Women Act of 1994.
 Adding year-fixed effects allows us to control for omitted variables bias
 related to unobserved factors changing over time across all states.
 Similarly, state-fixed effects allow us to control for state-specific unobserva
ble variables.
 For instance, certain states may have particular practices specific to
 them that may impact African-American mortality rates.
 The fixed-effect model is considered a generalization of the difference-in-diff
erences model 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "lovenheim_long-run_2019,anderson_does_2015,huebener_compressing_2017,allison_using_1994"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 By controlling for state fixed effects, we effectively control for treatment
 and control units, at the same time allowing treatment and control units
 to vary over state.
 By controlling for time fixed effects, we control for pre- and post- treatment,
 while allowing for time trends.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the fixed effects model, identification requires that the unobserved
 factors specific to a particular state and year need to be independent
 of the outcome and the variable of interest.
 For example, the laws should not pass in response to a changes in mortality
 rates of African-American women, or in response to sociodemographic changes
 that might impact both the passing of the laws and the mortality rates
 of African-American women.
 Controlling for factors specific to each state and each year leaves the
 factors that may be correlated with the timing of laws in each state.
 I find no literature claiming that mandatory arrest laws were passed as
 a reaction to state-specific triggers or trends.
 In fact, the literature is unanimous in that mandatory arrest laws were
 triggered by nationwide events, such as the MDVE, a number of lawsuits
 and the pressure exerted by women's rights groups

A particular concern is that other policy changes could have been passed
 together with the arrest laws or that state-specific political trends could
 be correlated with the timing of the mandatory arrest laws.
 There is no evidence of this in the literature.

, among others, describe the conditions under which mandatory arrest laws
 were passed, and make no mention of any other laws that were passed at
 the same time.
 However, it is possible that mandatory arrest laws were possibly part of
 some other political trend that was unique to these states.
 While we control for factors specific to each state that are not changing
 in time, if there are political factors that changed over time and are
 correlated with the timing of mandatory arrest laws, these could bias the
 estimates.
 To be able to control for such factors, I include binary variables indicating
 party control in each one of the houses in each state for all given years.
 The binary variable denoting the composition of the state senates does
 not yield a significant estimate, but the one denoting the composition
 of the houses of representatives is significant.
 Addition of state-year specific political controls do not alter the significanc
e of my variables of interest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economic factors may also be important for mortality rates.
 If there are factors particular to a specific state, state-specific binary
 variables in the model will control for these.
 For instance, if there are economic factors that correlate with the particular
 timing of the passing of mandatory arrest laws in each state, they can
 bias the coefficient estimates.
 I include economic controls for each state-year for the average personal
 income, GDP and employment rates from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

 If there are such economic factors associated with the particulars of each

 State-specific time trends are a final check on the identification strategy.
 Even after the literature review, controlling for unobservable factors
 relating to each state, and the inclusion of political and economic controls
 particular to a specific state and year, there may be remaining unobserved
 confounding factors.
 State-specific linear time trends can capture any remaining unobserved

 Estimating if the impact is temporary or permanent is important to understand
 how society reacts as a whole to mandatory arrest laws.

 In another extreme, the deaths can be due to a long-term and sustained

 To obtain Figure

, I normalize the mortality rate changes of each of the states by their
 values before the law changes.
 This serves as a visual representation of controlling for state level unobserva
ble confounding factors.
 I also shift the timelines to meet at the year that a law was passed; this
 serves as a visual equivalent of controlling for time trends.
 Finally, I take the average of each state-year pair within the treatment
 (mandatory and recommended) and the control (discretionary) states.
 The line in the middle divides the data into before and after, and the
 dashed and the solid lines show the treatment and control.
 The mortality rate of African-American women in discretionary states follow
 a downward trajectory, while the mortality rate of African-American women
 in mandatory and recommended states deviate from their similar trajectory
 after the law has passed.
 After a few years, the difference begins to diminish and becomes indistinguisha
ble from statistical noise.

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 show that the mortality rates of African-American women increased in response
 to the passing of either mandatory or recommended arrest laws.
 I estimate a statistically significant increase of 25 to 75 deaths per
 100,000 in the mortality rate of African-American women.
 This can be interpreted as additional deaths attributable to the unintended
 consequences of mandatory and recommended arrest laws.
 The estimate remains statistically significant even after including state-speci
fic time trends.
 This confirms that partner arrest has unintended consequences for African-Ameri
can women; and that these consequences show up in their mortality rates.

\begin_layout Standard
In Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

, the results decrease in magnitude and statistical significance when state-spec
ific time trends are added.
 State-specific time trends should be interpreted with caution in this setting:
 if the mechanism leading to mortality is taking place in the short term,
 say, a few years after the arrest, then adding state-specific time trends
 acts as a reasonable check of validity on my results.
 However, if the impact is happening in the long term and is sustained,
 they may absorb some of the impact attributable to the arrest.
 This is because the state-specific time trends are constructed from the
 entirety of the timeline for each state, and as such, they incorporate
 the trends in mortality rates after an arrest law has been passed.
 In this case, the magnitude of the estimates will be biased downwards.
 Despite this caveat, I add state-specific linear time trends as an validity
 check.
 This inclusion follows literature, and the advice from

 These results support the findings from

\begin_layout Standard
One of the differences from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sherman2014increased"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 is in the real life setting, new potential victims keep coming in to the
 analysis: if arrest impacts all waves of victims equally, I would estimate
 a sustained increase in mortality rates, as each wave of new victims would
 keep adding to the mortality rates.
 However, the analysis shows that the impact is not sustained in the long
 run.
 The victims that were impacted are only the first wave of victims, and
 the mechanism took place in a few years.
 This suggests that the unintended consequences estimated by the current
 paper and 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sherman2014increased"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 are only effective when the victims and offenders are 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

suprised
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 by the laws.
 Like the victims from the MilDVE experiment, these 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

first wave
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 of victims were likely not aware of the consequences of reporting the offense.
 In this sense, they were similar to the victims in the experimental setting,
 uninformed, therefore did not have a chance to change their behavior in
 response to the arrest laws.
 Consequently, I observe the treatment effect of partner arrest in the first
 few years in the dynamic model.
 As time passes, potential offenders and victims are likelier to become
 informed about the legal change and the consequences of offending and reporting.
 In the long run, the net policy effect of mandating partner arrest becomes
 statistically insignificant.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It might be considered surprising that there are differences between the
 results from the experimental setting in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "sherman2014increased"
literal "true"

\end_inset

 and the results from the empirical setting.
 In reality, this sort of divergence happens.
 For example, alcohol consumption has been shown to lead to liver disease
 in clinical trials 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "herd_ideology_1992"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Based on this result, a policy maker can decide to outlaw alcohol.
 However, liver disease did not decrease with state prohibitions 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "dills_alcohol_2004"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 Mortality from alcohol-related causes decreased only with the constitutional
 prohibition, and then actually rose back to pre-prohibition levels, before
 the constitutional prohibition was lifted 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "miron_alcohol_1991"
literal "true"

\end_inset

.
 This is a clear example of how a treatment effect can be different in an
 experimental setting and in an empirical setting.
 Mandating or outlawing a certain treatment can change behavior of populations
 in the long run, leading to different outcomes outside of a randomized
 trial.
 In the case of prohibition, outlawing alcohol led to an unregulated market
 of alcohol.
 In the case of mandatory arrest law, mandating arrest created a deterrent
 that acted over a longer period of time, in a way that a randomized trial
 that ran once on a subset of individuals cannot create.
 This explains the divergence of the results from the experimental setting.

The results from all the models in the current paper paint the following
 picture: there are unintended consequences of a partner arrest, but these
 consequences affect only the first wave of victims at a statistically significa

 After a few years have passed under mandatory arrest laws, arrest seems
 to no longer increase mortality rates for victims.
 I interpret this as a result of potential offenders and victims adapting
 their behavior as they become informed about the legal regime they live
 under.
 In this sense, the victims and offenders in the first wave were similar
 to the victims and offenders from the experiment: they were not aware that
 arrest was a potential consequence, and were not able to mitigate whatever
 unintended consequences led to their demise.

This conclusion confirms the experimental findings of

\end_inset

 in an empirical setting in the short term, but also shows that the impact
 disappears in the long term.
 In the empirical setting, the first set of offenders were unaware that
 they could be arrested, and the victims suffered the eventual consequences
 of arrest.
 However, the current study shows that the overall impact is different when
 the offenders are informed.
 Subsequent potential offenders were likely deterred from offending because
 they became more and more aware of the legal regime.

An alternative interpretation is possible: victims, rather than the offenders,
 may have been deterred from reporting the crime.
 Research suggests that this is less likely:

 show that African-American women are more likely than white women to report
 domestic violence to the police.

 notes that this may be due to correlation to economic means, and that women
 with more income have more access to resources and may not need to rely
 on the police as much.

 Furthermore, reporting levels across mandatory and discretionary states
 are not significantly different from each other

The causal pathway that links the offender's arrest to the victim's death
 is not clear, but it is possible to discuss some possibilities.
 Lack of a clear cause of death, and the evidence of an increase in the
 mortality of African-American women (but not other groups) suggest that
 a complex interaction between racialized applications of policies, arrest
 and loss of resources may be increasing the likelihood of the victim's
 death.
 One such example can involve eviction:

key "desmond2012unpolicing"

\end_inset

 report examples of how victims were evicted because the house they were
 in has been subject of an arrest.
 Another type of interaction can involve the loss of spouse's work opportunities

There are other studies that find a link between arrest and job market opportuni
ties:

 is another example.

 These losses of opportunity or means can be detrimental to many.
 For individuals already at risk, it can have disastrous consequences.
 Domestic violence is already correlated with lower income and a lack of
 economic means, so individuals at risk of losing healthcare, falling below
 the poverty line and eviction are over-represented within the victims of
 domestic violence.
 Eviction can lead to homelessness for individuals who are already struggling
 to make ends meet, and loss of spousal income can push an individual below
 the poverty threshold.
 Both of these events can have health consequences, and these health consequence
s can increase the probability of death.

\begin_layout Standard
Based on the conclusions, I make the following policy recommendation: if
 policy makers decide to pass mandatory arrest laws, they should announce
 and inform the population in advance.
 This will give ample time for potential offenders to inform themselves
 and shift their behavior.
 This recommendation is not an endorsement of mandatory arrest laws in general:
 there are other policy measures that are geared towards supporting the
 victims rather than punishing the offenders.
 The results from 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "sherman2014increased"
literal "true"

\end_inset

, along with the current results, suggest that policy makers should pause
 before passing mandatory arrest laws.
 However, if they are going to be passed, informing the population beforehand
 is desirable to mitigate potential unintentional consequences of these
 laws.
