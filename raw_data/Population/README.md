Load the following two population files:

1. `uswbo19agesadj.dta` from [https://www.nber.org/data/seer_u.s._county_population_data.html](https://www.nber.org/data/seer_u.s._county_population_data.html)
2. `county_population.dta` from [http://www.nber.org/data/census-intercensal-county-population.html](http://www.nber.org/data/census-intercensal-county-population.html)

Only the first file is currently used. The second file is for cross-checking
the population values, and can be ignored if the relevant lines in the code
are crossed-out.
